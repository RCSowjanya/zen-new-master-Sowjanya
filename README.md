# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

To implement a contact form that sends email details to your client's email address upon submission, while ensuring security through SMTP, follow these detailed steps. This guide assumes you are using Node.js with Express for the backend and React for the frontend.

Step 1: Set Up Your Project
Create a New Directory for Your Project (if you haven't already):

bash
Copy code
mkdir visa-website
cd visa-website
Initialize Your Node.js Backend:

bash
Copy code
npm init -y
Install Required Packages:

bash
Copy code
npm install express nodemailer cors dotenv body-parser
Set Up Your React Frontend (if not already set up): Inside the same project directory, create a new React app:

bash
Copy code
npx create-react-app client
cd client
Step 2: Create Your Environment Variables
Create a .env file in your backend root directory to store sensitive information:

plaintext
Copy code
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_app_password
CLIENT_EMAIL=client_email@gmail.com
PORT=5000
Replace your_email@gmail.com with your email address.
Use an App Password if you have two-factor authentication enabled. See Google's guide on App Passwords for details.
Replace client_email@gmail.com with the client's email address where you want to receive form submissions.
Step 3: Set Up the Backend with Express and Nodemailer
Create a file named server.js in the root of your backend directory:
javascript
Copy code
// server.js
require('dotenv').config();
const express = require('express');
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const cors = require('cors');

const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

// Middleware
app.use(cors());
app.use(bodyParser.json());

// Configure Nodemailer
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
host: 'smtp.gmail.com',
port: 587,
secure: false, // true for 465, false for other ports
auth: {
user: process.env.EMAIL_USER, // Your email address
pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS // Your email password or app password
},
tls: {
rejectUnauthorized: false
}
});

// Endpoint to handle form submissions
app.post('/api/send-email', (req, res) => {
const { fullName, phoneNumber, email, message } = req.body;

const mailOptions = {
from: process.env.EMAIL_USER, // Your email
to: process.env.CLIENT_EMAIL, // Client's email
subject: 'New Form Submission',
text: `You have a new submission from:
    Name: ${fullName}
    Phone: ${phoneNumber}
    Email: ${email}
    Message: ${message}`
};

transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => {
if (error) {
console.error('Error sending email:', error);
return res.status(500).send('Error sending email');
}
console.log('Email sent:', info.response);
res.status(200).send('Email sent successfully');
});
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
Step 4: Create the React Frontend
Go to your React app directory and open src/App.js (or create a new component for the form).

Update src/App.js or create a new component for your form:

javascript
Copy code
// src/App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
fullName: '',
phoneNumber: '',
email: '',
message: '',
});
const [isSubmitted, setIsSubmitted] = useState(false);

const handleChange = (e) => {
const { name, value } = e.target;
setFormData({ ...formData, [name]: value });
};

const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
e.preventDefault();

    try {
      const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/send-email', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(formData),
      });

      if (response.ok) {
        setIsSubmitted(true);
      } else {
        console.error('Failed to send email');
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error:', error);
    }

};

if (isSubmitted) {
return (
<div className="flex items-center justify-center h-screen">
<h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-500">
Thank you for your submission!
</h1>
</div>
);
}

return (
<div>
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
<input type="text" name="fullName" placeholder="Full Name" onChange={handleChange} required />
<input type="text" name="phoneNumber" placeholder="Phone Number" onChange={handleChange} required />
<input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email" onChange={handleChange} required />
<textarea name="message" placeholder="Your Message" onChange={handleChange} required />
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
</div>
);
}

export default App;
Step 5: Run Your Applications
Run the Backend Server: Open a terminal in your backend directory (where server.js is located) and run:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
Run the React App: Open another terminal in your React app directory and run:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Step 6: Testing
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port your React app is running on).
Fill in the form and click submit.
You should see the thank you message, and the client's email should receive the form details.
Additional Considerations
CORS Issues: If you deploy your app, ensure your server allows requests from your frontend origin. You might need to configure CORS accordingly.

Security: Always keep your email credentials safe. Use environment variables, as shown above, to prevent them from being exposed in your code.

Deployment: You can deploy your backend to platforms like Heroku, DigitalOcean, or any cloud service that supports Node.js. Your React frontend can be deployed on Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

SSL/TLS: If you're using this in a production environment, make sure your email sending is secure by using SSL/TLS.

By following these steps, you can successfully set up a contact form that sends details to your client's email using SMTP with full protection. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

To implement the contact form with email functionality using SMTP, follow these steps to place the code in the appropriate files within your project structure:

Project Structure
You should have a structure similar to this after setting up both the backend and frontend:

bash
Copy code
visa-website/
├── client/ # Your React frontend
│ ├── public/
│ ├── src/
│ │ ├── App.js # Main file for your React app
│ │ ├── index.js
│ │ └── ...
│ └── package.json
├── server.js # Your Node.js backend
├── .env # Environment variables
└── package.json # Backend package.json
Step-by-Step Placement of the Code
Backend Code in server.js:

Open or create the server.js file in the root of your project (where you created the Node.js server).
Copy the backend code provided earlier into this server.js file.
javascript
Copy code
// server.js
require('dotenv').config();
const express = require('express');
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const cors = require('cors');

const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

// Middleware
app.use(cors());
app.use(bodyParser.json());

// Configure Nodemailer
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
host: 'smtp.gmail.com',
port: 587,
secure: false, // true for 465, false for other ports
auth: {
user: process.env.EMAIL_USER, // Your email address
pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS // Your email password or app password
},
tls: {
rejectUnauthorized: false
}
});

// Endpoint to handle form submissions
app.post('/api/send-email', (req, res) => {
const { fullName, phoneNumber, email, message } = req.body;

const mailOptions = {
from: process.env.EMAIL_USER, // Your email
to: process.env.CLIENT_EMAIL, // Client's email
subject: 'New Form Submission',
text: `You have a new submission from:
    Name: ${fullName}
    Phone: ${phoneNumber}
    Email: ${email}
    Message: ${message}`
};

transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => {
if (error) {
console.error('Error sending email:', error);
return res.status(500).send('Error sending email');
}
console.log('Email sent:', info.response);
res.status(200).send('Email sent successfully');
});
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
Environment Variables in .env:

Create a file named .env in the root of your project.
Add the following lines to the .env file, replacing placeholders with your actual values:
plaintext
Copy code
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_app_password
CLIENT_EMAIL=client_email@gmail.com
PORT=5000
Frontend Code in src/App.js:

Open src/App.js in your React project directory.
Replace the content of App.js with the following code, which implements the form and submission functionality:
javascript
Copy code
// src/App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
fullName: '',
phoneNumber: '',
email: '',
message: '',
});
const [isSubmitted, setIsSubmitted] = useState(false);

const handleChange = (e) => {
const { name, value } = e.target;
setFormData({ ...formData, [name]: value });
};

const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
e.preventDefault();

    try {
      const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/send-email', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(formData),
      });

      if (response.ok) {
        setIsSubmitted(true);
      } else {
        console.error('Failed to send email');
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error:', error);
    }

};

if (isSubmitted) {
return (
<div className="flex items-center justify-center h-screen">
<h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-500">
Thank you for your submission!
</h1>
</div>
);
}

return (
<div>
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
<input type="text" name="fullName" placeholder="Full Name" onChange={handleChange} required />
<input type="text" name="phoneNumber" placeholder="Phone Number" onChange={handleChange} required />
<input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email" onChange={handleChange} required />
<textarea name="message" placeholder="Your Message" onChange={handleChange} required />
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
</div>
);
}

export default App;
Step 4: Run Your Applications
Run the Backend Server: Open a terminal in your project root directory (where server.js is located) and run:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
Run the React App: Open another terminal in your client directory (where the React app is) and run:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Step 5: Testing
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port your React app is running on).
Fill in the form and click submit.
You should see the thank you message, and the client's email should receive the form details.
Step 6: Deployment
Deploying the Backend: You can deploy the backend to platforms like Heroku, Vercel, or DigitalOcean. Make sure to set the environment variables on the platform.
Deploying the Frontend: You can deploy the React app on Netlify or Vercel.
Additional Considerations
Make sure your backend is running whenever you want to test the form locally.
Adjust CORS settings if necessary, especially when deploying.
Always keep your environment variables secure.
Following these steps will allow you to set up the contact form correctly with email functionality and deployment. If you have any further questions or need more assistance, feel free to ask!
